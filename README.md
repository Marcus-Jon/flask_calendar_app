# Flask Calendar Web Application
A simple calendar web application built in Python using the Flask library. Allows for login to an account which provides the user with a calendar which they can add events to.  
The web application is designed to be implemented in a three-tier system. These tiers are based on the model-view-controller (MVC) model of operating, whilst making use of RESTful service definitions to communicate between the elements defined by the MVC. The three tiers include a front-end, backend and a database, with the front-end acting as an MVC view and the backend as the model. The web application will be hosted on a web server which will contain a web framework for Python, along with the REST resources.

## Variants
### PostgreSQL
Code available in the Main/Master branch uses a PostgreSQL database and was originally written as an assignment for university.
### MySQL
Code available in the MySQL branch is modified to use a MySQL database instead which is required for the hosted version for the demo.
